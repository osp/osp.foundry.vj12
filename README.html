  <body><h1>VJ12</h1><p><em>Ubiquitous Grey literature radiates out from the margins and regulates the relationship between machines and humans.</em></p>
<p>A font developed for the 2009 edition of the <a href="http://constantvzw.org/vj12/">Verbindingen/Jonctions</a> Festival. The images on the festival&#8217;s posters were text files. A font may be a set of black blocks!</p>
<p>It is based on Linux Libertine. Once the measurements have been made, these instructions apply to any glyph:<br/>
    pen.moveTo((left,desc))<br/>
    pen.lineTo((left,asc))<br/>
    pen.lineTo((right,asc))<br/>
    pen.lineTo((right,desc))<br/>
    pen.closePath()</p></body>
